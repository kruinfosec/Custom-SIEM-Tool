#### **Key Features:**
1. **Automated Log Collection:**
   - Collect logs from various sources (e.g., Linux system logs, firewall logs) in real-time.

2. **Event Correlation:**
   - Implement correlation rules to detect patterns indicative of security threats.

3. **Automated Playbook Generation:**
   - Automatically generate playbooks based on detected threats, providing clear action steps for incident response.

4. **Automated False Positive Management:**
   - Implement mechanisms to learn from user feedback to reduce false positive alerts.

5. **Real-Time Dashboard:**
   - Develop a user-friendly dashboard to visualize security events, alerts, and system health metrics.

6. **Integration with MySQL:**
   - Use MySQL for storing logs, events, and generated playbooks, ensuring efficient data management.

#### **Technology Stack:**
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Server LTS (for testing and deployment)
- **Programming Languages:** 
  - Python (for scripting and backend logic)
  - C++ (for performance-critical components)
- **Database:** MySQL (for log storage and management)
- **Web Framework:** Flask or a similar framework (for the dashboard)
- **Containerization:** Docker (optional, for deployment)

### **Goals:**
- Create a functional, efficient SIEM tool that automates key security monitoring tasks.
- Ensure the tool is user-friendly and provides actionable insights for security teams.
- Test thoroughly in a controlled Linux environment to prepare for production deployment.
